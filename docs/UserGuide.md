## Introduction

Always accessing MyAnimeList or IMDB to record down the shows you watched? Or finding it difficult to search the different websites that stored your show information? Fret not because **Trackermon** is the app just for you! But hold on, you may be wondering what is Trackermon?

Trackermon is a **desktop application** for **tracking and managing shows, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface ([CLI](#glossary))** while still having the **benefits of a Graphical User Interface ([GUI](#glossary))**. Trackermon allows you to track and remember what shows you have watched, are currently watching, or plan to watch.

2. Download the latest version of **Trackermon** [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/releases).

3. Move the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for **Trackermon**.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. A [GUI](#glossary) containing the annotated 4 main components should show up as below:

5. Start communicating with Trackermon using the command box.

Some example commands you can try:

* **`list`** : Lists all shows.

* **`add`** `n/ReZero s/watching t/Anime` : Adds a show **named** `ReZero` with the **tag** `Anime` to Trackermon as **watching**.

* **`delete`** `3` : Deletes the **3rd show** shown in the current list.

## Command structure

Let us look at what makes up a command:

| Component    | Description                                                           |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Command Word | The keyword representing the action of the command                    |
| Prefix       | The keyword to recognise command parameters                           |
| Parameters   | Follows directly behind a prefix and contains the corresponding value |

For example, a command to find a show could look like this:

`find n/ Django` 

In the example above , `find` is the **command word** while `n/` is the **prefix** of the `Djanjo` **parameter**. A list of parameters along with their prefixes and descriptions have been included below for your convenience.

| Parameters | Prefix | Description                                                                            |
|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| KEYWORD    | None   | The input after the command word                                                       |
| INDEX      | None   | The index of the show as shown in the show panel list                                  |
| NAME       | n/     | The name to use for a show                                                             |
| STATUS     | s/     | The three statuses to label for a show are _COMPLETED_, _WATCHING_ and _PLAN-TO-WATCH_ |
| TAG        | t/     | The tag to label a show                                                                |
| COMMENT    | c/     | The comment to describe a show                                                         |
| RATE       | r/     | The rating to give a show                                                              |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Sex and the City`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/<NAME> s/<STATUS> [c/<COMMENT>] [t/TAG]…` can be used as `n/ReZero s/completed c/What a Simp t/Anime` or as `n/ReZero s/completed`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Anime`, `t/Sitcom t/Kdrama` etc.

* A whitespace must be included before every prefix.<br>
  e.g. `n/Knives Out t/Suspense` is acceptable but `n/Knives Outt/Suspense` is not.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME [t/TAG]…​`, `[t/TAG]…​ n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* All **names must be unique** and duplicates will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if you try to add `n/Inception` into the show list that already contains that show, there will be a message telling you that this show already exists in the list.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/Batman n/Superman`, only `n/Superman` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `exit` and `list` ) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.

* The **index** parameter provided should be a [non-zero unsigned integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science)) within the allowed range of Java’s [`int`](#glossary) data type. On top of that, the index should be within the bounds of the show list.<br>
  e.g. If there are 5 shows saved in the show list, then the valid index ranges from 1 to 5.

**Description (Precise Find):** Searching for a show across specific [parameters](#command-structure)? Find shows containing the search words based on [prefix](#command-structure)!

**Format (Precise Find):** `find [n/NAME] [s/STATUS] [r/RATE] [t/TAG]…​`

**Example & Output:** `find n/Shutter Island`

[INSERT IMAGE AFTER UI IS DONE COMPLETELY]

**:information_source: Notes about Precise Find:**<br>
* **Within a single [prefix](#command-structure)** and **across multiple [prefixes](#command-structure)**, an [**AND search**](#glossary) is executed across Trackermon's show list and only shows with matching [parameters](#command-structure) will be returned.
* `find n/Shutter Island` displays all the shows in the Trackermon's show list that contain **Shutter** and **Island** in the `NAME` parameter.
* `find n/Django s/completed r/3 t/Action` displays all the shows in the Trackermon's show list that contain **Django** in the `NAME` parameter, **completed** in the `STATUS` parameter, **3** in the `RATE` parameter and **Action** in the `TAG` parameter.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:bulb: **Tip:**
Find is case-insensitive, and the order in which the keywords are entered is irrelevant. Partial words **will** be matched as well. e.g., `attac` will match `attack`.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:exclamation:**Caution:**<br>
* There must be at **least one [prefix](#command-structure) followed by a [parameter](#command-structure)** and it **must not be empty**.

:exclamation:**Multiple of the same prefixes:**<br>
* find `find n/attack n/on n/titan n/S2` does not mean `find n/attack on titan S2`. The former will only find show names that match with **S2** (as mentioned in [features](#features)) while the latter will find all show names that match **attack, on, titan, and S2**. This is only applicable to the `NAME` parameter.
* find `t/Anime t/Action` does not mean `find t/Anime Action`. The former will find show tags that match with **Anime** and **Action** in the `TAG` parameter while the latter will show you that it is an **invalid command format**. This is only applicable to the `TAG` parameter.

* Use ssd/ to sort status in descending order.
* If there are no prefix, it will sort by name in ascending order.
* If both prefixes for ascending and descending are used for the same attribute, it will only sort by ascending.
* If both prefixes for name and status are used, by default, it will sort by name then status.
* Use so/ to sort by status then name.
